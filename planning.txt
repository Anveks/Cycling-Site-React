1. database
2. get all route + handle images
3. basic client-side with data from get all
4. auth-register-login backend:
 - user - adding to favorites/filters/seeing route details
 - admin - CRUD features/seeing all users + user activity

 things to think about:
 - consider a way to unite all the 3 filters functions into one 
 - think of a way to avoid using loggedIn state in 3 separate components (duplication of code)
 - check if sending an id via custom header of a request is an OK practice
